Introduction:
The idea for the name of the website is after the family business.  My grandfather opened the business
for trading in 1939 just before the second world war and it still trades today.  He called it G&J Geddis Pawnbroking.

Scope of the project:
I will build the structure of this website using Bootstrap and build it using just HTML and CSS. 
I want to build a simple website that allows for the family business to share images of the goods
they sell to the current and a wider range of customers.  It will also 
give their customers some key information on pawnbroking and the history of the
business.

Features:
The features of this site will be mainly based around giving customers the insights into the business 
products and services that is offered.
So there will be two main pages.  The first page will be the pawnbroking page.  This will explain 
to the customer how pawnbroking broking works and some of the main rules and agreements that needs
to be made to allow you to pawn an item.  



Testing of the webpage:
I will have tested this webpage by checking it through the browser in all formats.
to include Desktop,tablet and mobile (Google Chrome).
