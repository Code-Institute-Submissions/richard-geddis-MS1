### Introduction:
The idea for the name of the website is after the family business.  My grandfather opened the business
for trading in 1939 just before the second world war and it still trades today.  It called it G&J Geddis Pawnbroking.
I Came with the idea for this website after my father the owner of the business said he would love to
be able to take the business online to reach a wider customer base as with the COVID and before that the 
financial crash people have not wanted to leave their homes or have had little money to spend on luxery 
items.


### UX Design:
This section gives an in-dept look into the UX design process, 
focusing on who the G&J Geddis Pawnbroking website is for and the main aims of the project 
in the eye of the user.

### Project Goals:
* To get people informed on what G&J Geddis have to offer.
* To learn about pawnbroking and the rules and regulations around it.
* To be able to easily contact G&J Geddis pawnbroking and submit any enquiries.
* To present information about the history of G&J Geddis Pawnbroking.
* To create a website that is fully responsive on mobiles, laptops,tablets and desktops.

### Strategy Plane:
The main goal of the website is to attract customers to be able to learn about
G&J Geddis Pawnbroking. The website is aimed at customers who would like to know more 
about the business and what we have to offer. It will include some imagery related to the 
topic of the website. I started the UX process by thinking about what my father would like to see
on the family business website and I started from there.

The key features of the website were developed based on customers needs. 
Customers should be able to do the following on the website:

* Learn about the Pawnbroking industry
* Easily get in contact with G&J Geddis Pawnbroking.
* Learn about a small range of products that we have available to sell.
* View images related to the products we have on offer.
* Visit the organisations social media channels.
* Navigate easily throughout the website.

### Skeleton Plane:
I started to develop my wireframes at this point. I used Balsamiq wireframes to create  each page.
The main aim was to make sure the main content is similar in design so as to be able to create consistency,
and is execute the website to a highest level I could achieve.
I thought that the user should have an easy and simple navigation bar with 4 choices one of which 
is a dropdown menu.
Here is a list of what is on each page:

 Home- consists of the nav-bar, a front image of the shop, basic information such as opening hours,
The twitter feed, a brief history of the company and the footer linking to the main pages and to social links.

Pawnbroking - this again comsists of the same nav-bar and image of the shop front along with the same footer.
there is also three columns which gives alot of written information to include.  
1. How pawnbroking works
2. What the customer can pawn.
3. The legal side of Pawnbroking.

Products- This page will consist of a breakdown of a further four pages.
1. jewellery
2. footwear
3. uniforms.
All pages will have a small range of images of  the items in which we sell at G&J Geddis Pawnbroking
with a small amount of detail below.  There will also be the nav-bar along the top.
 with the footer at the bottom linking the customers to social media links.

 Contact us-  This page will have a form which will allow people to fill in there name and email
 address so as they can sign up for the newsletter informing the customer of any new deals or any
 information on the pawnbroking business that might affect their goods which they have in pawn with
 us currently.

From these wireframes you can see the outline of my project and from that I got started writing my code.
There is quite a big difference between the appearance of the wireframes and the website. 
The wireframes helped me decide what had to be put into the website. But I found as I got coding 
the webpage started to change and the content changed with it.

### Surface Plane:

The next stage was to move onto the design stage of the website.

The first stage was the colour. This website is based around information it has alot of text in it
and alot of legal information. With that I dont want to go crazy with colour.  It should be a 
minimalist website with little clutter or distractions.

Color - 
The main colour will be #ffc34d, rgb(255, 195, 77).  This will be the colour of the nav bar and other 
key features such as the buttons and any icons that i may use through the site.
I will also have the titles using #0000e6, rgb(0, 0, 230) This is to match in with the colour
of the shop front which is blue.
The back ground of the footer will be a very pale grey #afaff almost white.  As i have meantioned
I want to keep this site minimalist and although it needs to look attractive I want it to look clean. 

Typography -
I used Google Fonts to select the fonts for my project. 
The Roboto font is the main font used for this website.  Should something
happen to Google then Sans Serif will be used  as the fallback font. 

Imagery - 
The Hero image across all pages was from a family picure of the business used in most of the 
Marketing campaigns.  The rest of the images found from google images.

Layout- 
The layout of the site should be over 4 main pages with dropdown holding another 3 which will be a 
gallery of some of the products in which we have for sale. 


### Testing done on Different Devices:
I manually tested the website on Chrome browser using the chrome developer tools. I did this to 
check the full functionality of the website and check all links worked and fuctioned properly
on each of these devices.
1. I have tested it on desktop mode 
2. mobile phone mode to include iphone 6, iphone 6 plus, google pixel, and samsung galaxy S5
3. Tablet mode I have tested it in ipad, ipad pro and surface duo.

### Technologies Used:
Here is a list of some the technologies I have used in building this website:

1. CSS3
The language used to style the HTML5.

2. JavaScript
I have added some simple JavaScript which comes directly from the bootstrap website.

3. Gitpod
 Gitpod has been used to write the code for the website.

4. Git Hub
I have used GitHub repository hosting service to host my current and track my previous verions of 
the website.

### Other Tools Used:
Here is a list of the other tools that i have used throughout this project to help me complete it.
* Google Images has been used to get images for the product section of the website.
* Balsamiq wireframes has been used to help build the design of the website.
